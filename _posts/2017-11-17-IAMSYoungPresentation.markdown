I presented my work on the <a href="https://www.iams.sinica.edu.tw/iams_yfrp/"> IAMS Young Fellow Research Presentation Contest </a> on Nov. 13., and was very lucky to be elected the best presenter with the Gold prize. I thank Professor Chou for giving me many opportunities to present my work, and Professor Kaito Takahashi for dedicatedly organizing these amazing events. I also thank other constestants for giving me kind evaluations. The prize will be officially awarded during the IAMS End Year Party on Jan. 5.
